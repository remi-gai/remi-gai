# Hi there 👋

Currently building [Inco](https://www.inco.org/). Previously I was a web3 founder fellow part of [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com/), with a background in engineering (Google, Microsoft), entrepreneurship (founding member of [Parallel Finance](https://parallel.fi)), product management (web3 UX lead at co-founded blockchain studio), and venture capital ([8 decimal capital](https://www.8dcapital.com/)).

Fun fact: I am a 🇺🇸🇫🇷🇨🇳 native speaker

## 🔨Fun Crypto Projects 👷
Parallel Finance: Suite of DeFi protocols (AMM, money market and liquid staking) built on Polkadot, **backed by Polychain, Sequoia, Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, and more. We originally started from a Polkadot Hackathon in 2021 during which we won third place**. ([website](https://parallel.fi))

SlowSwap: The only on-chain MEV prevention solution using VDF (verifiable delay function). **Won finalist in DeFi track at EthDenver 2022 Hackathon**. ([website](https://slowswap.io/)) ([demo](https://www.loom.com/share/4c0c61677a454b2caf3d5c8dbcc8f62d)) ([deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_l_fTgkCr1M5mdyuOgL47yFDxU7thssU_jgJY9An3B4/edit#slide=id.g115fe3e9780_0_0)) ([github](https://github.com/SlowSwap))

Starknet Recovery Service: The first on-chain wallet recovery service for Ethereum Externally Owned Accounts (EOA), powered by storage proofs on StarkNet. **Won first place at the Starknet House Hackathon in 2022**. ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5FvzoQhGv8&feature=youtu.be)) ([deck](https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/09ce2e68-01a6-42e2-a195-f5e548aea711/06a878ce-878b-4a1f-9be1-9e125372f4f4/000db933-2625-425b-a1ba-3743a395967f)) ([github](https://github.com/Starknet-Recovery-Service))

Stark x: The first natively cross-chain and composable Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEX deployed on StarkNet for trustless settlement and asset liquidity, powered by storage proofs and SNARK proofs. **Won first place at the Starknet Encode Autumn Hackathon in 2022**. ([website](https://starkx.xyz)) ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFHXK6_lEQ&ab_channel=ParkYeung)) ([deck](https://pitch.com/public/e5498d39-8a7b-45af-babf-7871ec2d938e)) ([github](https://github.com/stark-dex))

Madara (L3) x Celestia (DA) integration: This is a modular approach of integrating Madara (L3) with Celestia (DA), so that state diff is posted on a data availability layer instead of L1 calldata. 94.9% of Starknet's gas usage was due to state diff calldata settlement on L1, which is very costly. Lambda Week Hackathon in Paris 2023. ([deck](https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/82d36efd-f5f4-43cd-b2a8-b058dfa5db37/ee7db963-0ed1-45fe-9d6a-4a15c71da6d5/c6a4f7cf-d5be-4589-bd04-9b903239cbb1)) ([github](https://github.com/mathieu-chauvin/madara/tree/da-celestia))

LiquidBit: NFT marketplace aggregator (similar to gem.xyz) and derivatives (futures, option, and fractional) for professional traders and institutions. ([website](http://liquidbit.xyz/))

EVM Wars: omni-chain ERC721 NFT standard and cross-chain battle royal NFT game across Polygon, Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom and Binance Chain, built using Layer Zero’s cross-chain messaging protocol. ([website](https:/evmwars.com)) ([demo](https://www.loom.com/share/a9aaa9a1947f426bba7e2665f31004a4)) ([deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11uEmXt3FNiTrr5a1M4f48CFepxBphRFZxIneAk1xUv8/edit#slide=id.g13c04f8c253_0_20))

Starknet Naming Service: The equivalent of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) for Starknet. Starknet Name Service domains are secure domain names for the decentralized world. ([demo](https://www.loom.com/share/d18d5a8fe37445ed8cc861bd7c675078)) ([github](https://github.com/Starkware-Naming-Service/cairo-contracts))
